# Floes

We currently don't understand how sea-ice floes melt and respond to ocean/atmopshere forcings, particulary around Antarctica. By using IceSat2 data, we could begin to characterise the thickness distribution of sea-ice floes during the Spring/Summer period. In parallel, looking at SAR/MODIS data could provide floe size distribution at concomitant times, which we could compare to corresponding Arctic studies.
